            <h3>The Website has various components , the first page displays about the inspirational quotes,
                to keep us through the tough times.
                It has the games section, which has two games, tic-tac-toe and pong.
                Two people can play at the same time, and also listen to music which plays automatically
                the website.</h3>

            <h1>The main idea behind the website<br></h1>
            <h3><br>During, these tough times of Covid-19, I thought of propagating an idea through a website,
                which would help people to pass their time according to their interest. Though, the website contains
                very fewer sections currently, but in the nearby future I would add many more sections and make the
                website more interactive!
